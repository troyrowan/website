Troy Rowan is a PhD candidate in the MU Animal Genomics group at the University of Missouri. He works at the intersection of population genetics, quantitative genetics, genomics, and animal breeding with the goal of improving livestock efficiency and sustainability. His major research uses novel applications of genome-wide linear mixed models to identify signatures of selection and local adaptation in cattle populations.
